# Plan For Dev_1.

### For my Dev_1 I'm probably going to rewrite all my code. I'm going to have a form that takes in at least two forms of inputs, the first for what kind of videogame genre you like play and the second for what device you play games on. Then its going to take the inputs and give back a (Dated + ID) recommendation inside of a div below the form that lists the top 10 games for the genre picked as long as they're playable for the device chosen. This will be the create and read.

### For the update and delete I will include a modify button that allows a user to check which games they've already completed and delete games they have no interest to play. I will make sure to include some css and make the website videogame themed, as well as simulate a user login. I still haven't picked which 2 JavaScript code examples to implement into the project, but I will update this file when I do.
